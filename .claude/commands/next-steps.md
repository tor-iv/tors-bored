Search this repository for next steps, incomplete features, and items that need to be implemented.

## Part 1: Explicit Markers
Search for:
1. TODO comments in the code (TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, NOTE)
2. Any PROGRESS.md or similar tracking files
3. Placeholder implementations or stub functions
4. Comments mentioning "not implemented", "coming soon", "later", or "future"
5. Disabled or commented-out features

## Part 2: Analysis & Suggestions
Review the codebase and identify:
1. Features that appear incomplete or half-finished (missing validation, error handling, edge cases)
2. UI/UX elements that could be more polished or professional
3. Missing functionality that would be expected for this type of application
4. Code that could benefit from refactoring or optimization
5. Security or performance concerns
6. Accessibility improvements needed
7. Missing tests or documentation gaps
8. Integration opportunities (e.g., Stripe not fully wired up, missing email notifications)

## Output Format
Organize findings into:
- **Explicit TODOs** - Items marked in code with file locations
- **Incomplete Features** - Partially built functionality
- **Polish Opportunities** - UI/UX and professionalism improvements
- **Suggested Enhancements** - New features or improvements not listed anywhere

For each item, include the file location (if applicable) and a brief actionable description.
